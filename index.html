        <h2>Let&#x27;s start with WHY...</h2>
        <p>PPM Pro is a key SPBU initiative aimed at <strong>consolidating all of our NPD and Cost Reduction project data into a single source.</strong> We want a single source of truth from which to answer in real-time questions like, &quot;How many Rotary Projects are active? How many resources are assigned to those projects? What phase are those projects in? What do the financials look like for those projects post-launch?&quot; </p>
        <p>This software will be a game changer in terms of our organization&#x27;s portfolio management, and<strong> will also replace </strong><strong><em>JourneyX </em></strong>for all timesheet information - using the data gathered from those timesheets to not only ensure we are able to provide Finance with the information they need for R&amp;D tax credits, but also to ensure that we are aligned with our business priorities by validating that we are actually giving our most attention and hours to the highest priority projects.</p>
        <h4>Who is leading this implementation? When is it coming?</h4>
        <p>The project was sponsored by Ed Merwald and assigned to the Tech Teams to take the lead on implementation. James Laugerman has taken the role of product owner and is working with a team from all business units to configure the software, pilot it on a few projects, and eventually release training and documentation to the entire company. The implementation team includes Kyle Dungan (IBU), Adam Peterson (SSV), Megan Bantz (ROT), Jill Best, Kurtis Jensen (IBU), Lucas Rozendaal (Tech), Melissa Souter (EP), and Shelby Daniels (ROT). </p>
        <h4>When is it coming?</h4>
        <p>Current pilot projects are underway in the Rotary group, with the hope that we can begin using PPM Pro for <strong>ALL SPBU NPD and Cost Reduction Projects by the end of FY23 Q3. </strong>Further details will be sent about timesheets, with the hope that all timesheets will be converted from JourneyX into PPM Pro by the end of Q3.</p>
        <h4>How does this work with the tools we already use? </h4>
        <p>PPM Pro should <strong>seamlessly integrate with LeanKit</strong> boards already in place. Additionally, there is an open-API which allows for endless data integration possibilities, from CodeBeamer or Jira boards to Oracle expense reports. </p>
        <h4><strong>I&#x27;m a project manager ... where can I find out more?</strong></h4>
        <p>Here&#x27;s a<a href="https://success.planview.com/?title=Planview_PPM_Pro/090_Resource_Capacity_Planning/010_Capacity,_Staffing_%26_Demand/010_About_Capacity_and_Demand"><strong> helpful overview</strong></a><strong> </strong>of how the resource planning works in PPM Pro. You can expect to receive more communication in the coming weeks on training. </p>
